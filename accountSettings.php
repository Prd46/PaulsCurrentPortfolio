    <p class="freeform paragraph">Discord is a widely used messaging app amongst teens and young adults, particularly connecting people in 
            the gaming sphere and other group communities. The official Discord website has a support page with 
            various help pages linked, each navigational button having a simplistic, yet stylized image to go with 
            it. Despite the art style being very lively and fun, the micro-interactions for the buttons are not. </p>

    <p class="freeform paragraph">Through the course of this project, I wanted to single out one of these buttons and enhance the 
            interactivity of it, to inject a bit more fun into the process of searching for information on Discord’s 
            website. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I was able to improve the aesthetics and interactivity of the 
            Account Settings button on this support page, continually refining over an alpha, beta, and final 
            release. In the new micro-interaction prototype that I’ve constructed, the spinning cogs and well-paced 
            fading, sliding, and size changing elements create a fun visual experience for the user, without taking 
            too much time away from their help-searching process, which is a massive improvement compared to the 
            existing micro-interaction on the Discord support page. </p>

    <p class="freeform paragraph">My initial inspiration / example service to work from was Venmo, and I had to 
        pick it apart to isolate a singular task flow that a person would go through when 
        using it. The only problem was that I hadn’t ever used Venmo before starting this 
        project, only knowing that it was specifically used for paying other people, and 
        I ended up missing some steps in the task flow. As a result, my own app design 
        had to be built more off of my own ingenuity, imagining how it would have to 
        function as a legitimate product, and there ended up being more steps than 
        necessary. However, for the main stand-out function of the app, allowing multiple 
        people to join in on a single transaction, it panned out very smoothly in the end</p>

    <p class="freeform paragraph">Where my creative ability really took flight was in the animation process. Seeing 
        my ideas all come together in a realistic in-app experience gave me so much more 
        confidence in the structure I had built. Everything happens so quickly and smoothly 
        that it could very well work as a real application, and that gives me the motivation 
        to pursue this further in the future. Not all of my animation ideas could be 
        realized, such as a more realist coin drop animation, but it still looks polished 
        and functional. For my first time using After Effects too, I’m incredibly proud of 
        the end result, and have been working more with the program to fine tune my skills.</p>
