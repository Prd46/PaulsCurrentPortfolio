        <p class="freeform paragraph">In addition to creating one of my favorite art pieces ever, this song 
            of mine, that had been started over a year ago, finally came together 
            with a push of inspiration. I was only really missing an ending that 
            would properly wrap up the song, and once I had that, I took to 
            making the video. The pastel rainbow color scheme of the artwork 
            worked so well with the hue change keyframes in After Effects, along 
            with this super cool hexagonal audio visualizer I made. As far as 
            production value goes, this is the best video I've made on my channel, 
            in every aspect.</p>
