    <p class="freeform paragraph">As one of my most in depth and successful projects at Drexel so far, Dine With 
        Dragons was an app that I designed as a Drexel centric payment app that would 
        allow students to pay for meals together without having to divvy up costs after 
        the fact. It is not a fully functional app, but it has been outlined and 
        prototyped with Figma, displaying comprehensive details on the inner workings and 
        an interaction demonstration fully animated in Adobe After Effects. This was my 
        final project for my Interaction Design class, and perhaps I can fully realize 
        it in the years to come at Drexel.</p>

    <p class="freeform paragraph">My initial inspiration / example service to work from was Venmo, and I had to 
        pick it apart to isolate a singular task flow that a person would go through when 
        using it. The only problem was that I hadn’t ever used Venmo before starting this 
        project, only knowing that it was specifically used for paying other people, and 
        I ended up missing some steps in the task flow. As a result, my own app design 
        had to be built more off of my own ingenuity, imagining how it would have to 
        function as a legitimate product, and there ended up being more steps than 
        necessary. However, for the main stand-out function of the app, allowing multiple 
        people to join in on a single transaction, it panned out very smoothly in the end</p>

    <p class="freeform paragraph">Where my creative ability really took flight was in the animation process. Seeing 
        my ideas all come together in a realistic in-app experience gave me so much more 
        confidence in the structure I had built. Everything happens so quickly and smoothly 
        that it could very well work as a real application, and that gives me the motivation 
        to pursue this further in the future. Not all of my animation ideas could be 
        realized, such as a more realist coin drop animation, but it still looks polished 
        and functional. For my first time using After Effects too, I’m incredibly proud of 
        the end result, and have been working more with the program to fine tune my skills.</p>
