        <p class="freeform paragraph">A site unfamiliar to most, yet important to me, is the site that I used to 
        download much of the necessary content to play the game Clone Hero, which is 
        essentially a computer version of Guitar Hero that gives you access to all existing 
        songs from the Guitar Hero games and various community made songs. The site as it stood 
        worked decently to find some individual songs, but I felt that the layout could be improved 
        to allow for easier filtration and analysis of the songs before somebody goes to 
        download a song. You can really only find songs that you know specific details about, 
        like the song name and the artist, or details about the chart of the song, such as the 
        difficulty and the playable instruments.</p>

        <img class="main__featuredImage" src="media/chorus-2.jpg" alt="old chorus layout" />
        <img class="main__featuredImage" src="media/choruslt.jpg" alt="New chorus layout">
        <p class="freeform paragraph">To give users a better way of looking for new songs to download, I redesigned the 
        filtration system to be more concise and easier to understand by lining it up with 
        details listed on the song. Once this design is coded and implemented, users will not 
        only be able to search for songs based on chart and song details but through how many 
        likes and downloads are on a specific chart. If the user comes across a song they may 
        wish to download, instead of downloading it into the game to check, they could click on 
        the album cover to the left hand side to play a preview of the song. As it stands, many 
        Clone Hero players will download large packs instead of individual songs so they could 
        listen to the previews in game. Those would also be available on the home page in the 
        new setlist carousel, as they are popular among players, but for those that are not 
        looking to use up large amounts of space on their computer for songs they will not 
        end up playing, this system of song searching will be much more effective for 
        handpicking the songs that players want, rather than just guessing at which packs to 
        download.</p>   

        <img class="main__featuredImage" src="media/sort.png" alt="category sort test results for content organization">
        <p class="freeform paragraph">The design process was interesting to follow through for the first time, as my 
        site choice was rather obscure and the user base was very specific. Quite literally,
            only people that have Clone Hero will have anything to get out of this site, and 
            since I play the game avidly, I had a decent understanding of the user base. Just 
            to be sure though, I was instructed to develop a user persona and do a card sort 
            test to see how users organized the content on their site. Most people organized 
            the content by official Guitar Hero content and community content, but a decent 
            portion split up the large setlist and the individual charts, so I added different 
            tabs for the both of them. The prototype does not include all the pages of what 
            the finished site would have, only the home and chart page, but within this 
            version, the carousel can move back and forth and the dropdown filter on the 
            chart page is functional.</p>

        <p class="freeform paragraph">The major difference between User Interface Design I and II was that our choice of 
            site to redesign was much more limited. While before we could choose whatever 
            site we wanted, we had to pick a type of site that was very content heavy, 
            specifically a news site, as directed by our instructor. Since I rarely pay 
            attention to the news, I was a bit reluctant to get started, but soon realized 
            that it’s essential that I need to be open to all types of sites and 
            configurations, since there are sites for almost anything, and I could be working 
            for any one of them someday as a user experience designer. It was a necessary pull 
            out of my comfort zone, and it gave me a huge confidence boost when the ideas 
            started flowing in.</p>

            </video> 
        </div>
        <p class="freeform paragraph">In my search for a news site that I would be interested in working with, I came 
                across ARTnews, which is dedicated to updating the art connoisseurs of the world 
                on what’s happening in the art world. Unfortunately for them (and fortunately for 
                me), there were quite a number of issues I ran into while exploring the site that 
                could be innovated on. The search bar gives you two categories to search from, but 
                neither of them are clickable, and the navigation of the site is incredibly 
                confusing, some heading tabs leading you to other sites entirely. While I was not 
                able to address the search issue, since I hadn’t learned coding at the time, I was 
                able to greatly simplify the site navigation by prioritizing the main interests 
                of the company (gaining more subscriptions, since they advertised it heavily 
                throughout their own pages), while putting the other specifications in the menu. 
                The rest of the page displays the leading articles, editor picks, most recent 
                uploads and top stories, taking up the majority of the screen space with large and 
                attention-grabbing pictures.</p>

            <p class="freeform paragraph">This was also the first project in which I had to consider responsive design, and 
                I ended up creating three different page layouts for the website: mobile first, 
                then tablet, and lastly desktop. While it’s structured in such a way to give more 
                breathing room, rather than needing to remove items that wouldn’t fit in smaller 
                designs, filling in the open space was also relatively difficult. However, I felt 
                it was important to do so, since the site had a lot of white space at the time, 
                but it felt somewhat contradictory to the nature of museum art as a whole. Some 
                of the images were nice and big, like a large painting on display, while others 
                were more subtle and less visible. I aimed to treat each image like it was a 
                painting, with large blown up pictures in a gallery view with “museum placards” 
                beneath to display the article title. I also amped up the immersion further 
                within the mobile designs, as the images contained in the articles, once just 
                thrown between large text walls in white space, became one with the article 
                itself. Each image was placed in the background behind the text, as though you 
                are looking into the framework of the painting itself. If you wanted to get a 
                closer look at the painting itself, you could click on the title of the painting, 
                or the “view image” link if it was not listed, and it would bring you into an 
                isolated space with a dark background and an overhead light, as if you were 
                actually in an art gallery to divert your full attention to it. The desktop space, 
                however, was too wide to display the whole images in the background, so I placed 
                it along the sides of the paragraphs for people to view while reading, rather than 
                after reading the section. This prevents readers from having to go back if they 
                forgot some details about the piece that were already written.</p>

            <p class="freeform paragraph">As one of my most in depth and successful projects at Drexel so far, Dine With 
                Dragons was an app that I designed as a Drexel centric payment app that would 
                allow students to pay for meals together without having to divvy up costs after 
                the fact. It is not a fully functional app, but it has been outlined and 
                prototyped with Figma, displaying comprehensive details on the inner workings and 
                an interaction demonstration fully animated in Adobe After Effects. This was my 
                final project for my Interaction Design class, and perhaps I can fully realize 
                it in the years to come at Drexel.</p>

                <img class="main__featuredImage" src="media/task.webp" alt="Original task flow for Dine with Dragons">
            <p class="freeform paragraph">My initial inspiration / example service to work from was Venmo, and I had to 
                pick it apart to isolate a singular task flow that a person would go through when 
                using it. The only problem was that I hadn’t ever used Venmo before starting this 
                project, only knowing that it was specifically used for paying other people, and 
                I ended up missing some steps in the task flow. As a result, my own app design 
                had to be built more off of my own ingenuity, imagining how it would have to 
                function as a legitimate product, and there ended up being more steps than 
                necessary. However, for the main stand-out function of the app, allowing multiple 
                people to join in on a single transaction, it panned out very smoothly in the end</p>

            <p class="freeform paragraph">Where my creative ability really took flight was in the animation process. Seeing 
                my ideas all come together in a realistic in-app experience gave me so much more 
                confidence in the structure I had built. Everything happens so quickly and smoothly 
                that it could very well work as a real application, and that gives me the motivation 
                to pursue this further in the future. Not all of my animation ideas could be 
                realized, such as a more realist coin drop animation, but it still looks polished 
                and functional. For my first time using After Effects too, I’m incredibly proud of 
                the end result, and have been working more with the program to fine tune my skills.</p>
