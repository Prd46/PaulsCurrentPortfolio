<h2>Youtube Channel Intro</h2>

    A simple animated idea I had a while back that ended up turning out very well. There are some slight 
    inconsistencies with the line work, but it otherwise looks very smooth and fluid, making it a good 
    loop for my intro video, where I explain what my channel is all about. I paired it to a song I 
    created called “Fives,” which is a simple synth song I created using several 5 note patterns. 
    Drawn and animated with Firealpaca.</p>
